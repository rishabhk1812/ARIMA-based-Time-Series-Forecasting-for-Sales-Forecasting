# ARIMA-based-Time-Series-Forecasting-for-Sales-Trends
This project utilizes advanced ARIMA time series forecasting models to predict future Bike sales trends based on historical data. By analyzing sales across various age groups, product categories, and regions, it provides actionable insights for business decision-making, optimizing inventory, and strategizing revenue growth in the upcoming year.

**Key Objectives:** 
The primary objective of this project is to leverage ARIMA time series forecasting models to predict future sales trends based on historical sales data. The project aims to analyze sales across different age groups, product categories, and regions, enabling the identification of potential growth patterns and providing actionable insights for future business strategies.

**Data Overview:**
The dataset consists of historical sales data including variables such as Date of Sales, Age Group, Country, Product Category, Subcategory, and Revenue. The data covers a wide range of time periods and captures various segments, providing a comprehensive view of sales performance. The data was carefully preprocessed to handle missing values and seasonal patterns before applying forecasting models.

**Approach:**
Using R software, we applied the ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model for time series analysis, which is highly effective in capturing underlying trends, seasonality, and noise in the sales data. The ARIMA model was trained on the historical data to understand the patterns and then forecast future sales trends.

To visualize the sales trends, we used Plotly, an interactive graphing library, to create clear and insightful plots of both historical and forecasted sales data. This made it easier to understand the potential direction of sales across different segments and time periods.

Expected Outcomes:

1. Sales Forecasting: Accurate predictions of future sales for the upcoming year, across product categories and age groups.
2. Trend Insights: A deeper understanding of the sales trends and patterns that can drive business decisions such as inventory management, marketing strategies, and product launches.
3. Forecasting Confidence: Reliable projections that help mitigate risks and plan for market demand fluctuations.

**Conclusion:**
The project successfully demonstrated the application of the ARIMA model for time series forecasting, offering a structured and data-driven approach to predict future sales. By using Plotly for interactive visualizations, the project provided clear insights into sales trends, which can be used to optimize business operations and drive strategic decision-making. The ability to forecast sales at a granular level, including different age groups and product categories, equips businesses with the tools needed to stay ahead of market demands.
